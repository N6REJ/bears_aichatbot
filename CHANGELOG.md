## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Auto Dark Mode Support**: Automatically detects system dark mode preference and applies it to the chat interface. Users can still manually toggle dark mode, which overrides the auto-detection.
- **Copy Conversation Button**: New toolbar button that allows users to copy the entire chat conversation to clipboard in a formatted text format with timestamps.
- **Connection Status Indicator**: Real-time connection status display showing online/offline state with visual indicators and automatic reconnection detection.
- **Chat Sound Notifications**: Optional sound effects for sent messages, received messages, and errors. Users can toggle sounds on/off with the new sound button in the toolbar.
- **Enhanced Toolbar**: New chat header toolbar with copy, sound toggle, and dark mode toggle buttons for better user control.
- **Notification System**: Toast-style notifications for user feedback on actions like copying conversations or toggling features.
- **Offline Mode Protection**: Prevents message sending when offline and displays appropriate error messages.
- **Improved Accessibility**: All new features include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
